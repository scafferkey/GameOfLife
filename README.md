# GameOfLife
A JS implementation of Conway's Game of Life with good scaling and the ability to change rules.

CURRENT FEATURES:
- CRUDE webpage with canvas based animation (but it shows it fine!)
- Hard Coded implementation of base rules of Conway's game of life
- Basically nothing else (this is a Minimum Viable Product)

TODO:

- Time controls:
    - Pausing and resuming
    - Incrementing backwards/forwards by a step (when paused)
    - reverse speed?
    - Skip to beginning/last generated state
- Allow for panning and zooming the canvas window using keyboard 
- Important - Bundle functionality into an object!!
- Data visualisation:
    - Tracking numbers of "alive" cells#
- Modular Rules
- Saving/Exporting Game states
- Library of interesting configurations
- Analysis of cell configurations/game rulesets for "interesting" results
- A prettier Webpage!
- Allow drawing things directly onto the screen

Really far off:
Alternate tiling systems (Hexagonal, triangular)
